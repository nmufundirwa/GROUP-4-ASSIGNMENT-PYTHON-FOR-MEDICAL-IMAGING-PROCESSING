# Problem Statement

Medical imaging is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but raw images often suffer from noise and poor contrast.  
This project builds a modular pipeline to:
- Load JPEG, PNG, and DICOM images
- Preprocess and enhance them using CLAHE and Gaussian blur
- Save normalized outputs for analysis or ML
